            <h1>Implant: Sacral Anterior Root Stimulator (SARS)</h1>
            <p>I was offered the option of having the implant when I was in hospital. There is a receiver placed somewhere in your lower stomach and connected to a few strands of your spinal chord&hellip;. and a transmitter to trigger the required reaction. The transmitter has three optional dial settings&hellip;. and when placed on your stomach and activated &hellip;. stimulates the relevant organ to respond.</p>

            <p><strong><u>Position one</u> :</strong><br>
            Will help to stimulate your bladder to release it\'s contents. The benefit being that you wouldn\'t have to wear a convene around the house, but would have to pay close attention to how much you drank regarding how long you left it before visiting the bathroom. To avoid ending up sat in a puddle.</p>

            <p><strong><u>Position two</u> :</strong><br>
            Will help to stimulate your bowel to release it\'s contents. Again, the frequency of your visits to the toilet will depend on your food intake.</p>

            <p><strong><u>Position three</u> :</strong><br>
            Will help to stimulate your penis into an erection.</p>

            <p>I was most interested in position three until I was told that there was only something like &nbsp;a 75% &nbsp;chance of it being operational.</p>

            <p>Before that, I had joked about it having to be mains supplied&hellip;. or at the very least, have rechargeable long life batteries.</p>

            <p>In the end, I concluded that my spinal chord had been through enough and that I would explore all other avenues. After all, there\'s the pump, the tablets and the injection to have fun with&hellip;. who knows what will be invented next ?</p>

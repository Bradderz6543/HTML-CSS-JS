            <h1>Erec-Aid</h1>
            <p>This device is also used by guys that want to enlarge their manhood, allegedly. Unfortunately, I haven\'t used it often enough to be able to either substantiate or contradict that little snippet of information.</p>
            <p>Basically, it\'s a pump that creates a vacuum around the penis and then draws the blood into it. Where it is then trapped with the use of the tension ring(s) that come with it.</p>
            <p>It can be a bit tricky to start with, but the more you practice the quicker and easier it becomes. It helps to have a wet wipe to hand too, to clear the excess gel.... but it is most certainly well worth the effort. I would argue that it gives the fullest erection of all, but to each his own.</p>
            <p>You may find it useful to lubricate the head of your penis too.... to prevent it sticking to the inside of the cylinder. Although it only takes a little shake to free it before you next pull the trigger.</p>
            <p>One word of caution, make sure that neither testicle will be on the wrong side of either of the bands. I\'ve done that a couple of times and the spasms experienced while correcting the mistake not only tell me how painful it would be if I could feel it, but they make Michael Flattley\'s \'Riverdance\' look like a walk in the park!</p>
            <p>Again, it is only advised that you leave the bands on for 30 minutes.... to avoid the said member turning purple &amp; falling off! It can, however, be incorporated into the love making session and be enjoyed together.</p>
            
            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Vacuum cylinder with tension ring(s) is placed over the penis.</li>
                <li>Pump removes air from cylinder, which causes penis to become erect.</li>
                <li>Tension ring is slid to base of penis to maintain erection; cylinder is removed.</li>
            </ol>
